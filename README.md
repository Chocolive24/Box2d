# Box2d

This is a set of programming exercises from Sae Institute Geneva made with Box2d and SFML.  
The exercises whose names begin with "00" are basic templates to help design the others.  
Exercises whose names begin with "0" and then continuous numbers are graded exercises. They are called Formative Exercices.    
The last folder is a template from our teacher to help us.

# 01-Formative Space Shooter.  

This is a Space shooter game.  
You can move your ship in every direction.  
You can shoot laser and bombs in the direction of your mouse cursor.  

## Basics element requiered in the program :  

* Make a space shooter using SFML and Box2D shooter
    * SFML : uses of sprites, sounds and game core loop
        * incorporate images
        * triggers projectiles on inputs
        * triggers sounds on collisions
    * Box 2D : uses of forces, colliders, forces to make projectiles
 

## Learning Objectives:
