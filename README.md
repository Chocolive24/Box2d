# Box2d

This is a set of programming exercises from Sae Institute Geneva made with Box2d and SFML.  
The exercises whose names begin with "00" are basic templates to help design the others.  
Exercises whose names begin with "0" and then continuous numbers are graded exercises. They are called Formative Exercices.    
The last folder is a template from our teacher to help us.
